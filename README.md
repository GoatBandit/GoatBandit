    <h3 align="center">Understanding my Repositories</h3>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Current Primary Focus:</h3>
    <h4>(Currently private)</h4>
    <p>Currently working on an app that won't become open-source until it's developed.</p>
    <h3>Favoured Repositories:</h3>
    <h4>FantasyMapGenerator</h4>
    <p>Still in development but I'm hoping it becomes a great tool for generating both large and small terrains.</p>
    <h4>GoatBandit.gitHub.io</h4>
    <p>Definitely a lot of bias in this choice as it's my portfolio website (still in development) but it's also my first delve into front-end programming.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3 align="center">Commit Information</h3>
    <h4>Just a little explanation on how I handle commits (and projects in general) to make them a bit more understandable!</h4>
    <h5>Commit Names:</h5>
    <p>I generally aim to give each commit a version number in order to keep track of updates. With it I can tell what I've been forgetting to update and also allows me to easily link each file change to the given commit. It just makes life a bit easier I guess.</p>
    <h5>Version Numbers:</h5>
    <p>The numbers actually mean something (sometimes)! Here's what I aim for the numbers to mean and how they change:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>v0.1         = Usually just boilerplate. There's nothing here besides the required initial files</li>
    <li>v0.2         = The projects first baby steps</li>
    <li>v0.3 - v0.8  = The alpha stages!</li>
    <li>v0.9 - v1.2  = The beta stages!</li>
    <li>v1.3+        = The project has left the early stages and should be able to be released!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The version numbers are intended to increase by a tenth for each major change (e.g. new features) and a hundreth for each minor change (e.g. bug fixes).</p>
    <p><font size="1">Of course this is only in a perfect world... Usually the version numbers just get messed up but the intention was always there!</p>

âš¡ Fun fact: Goats have rectangular pupils. It never stops being weird to look at...
