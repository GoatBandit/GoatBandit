# Hey, I'm Connor!

I'm a games developer who is passionate about spreading programming knowledge through accessible content and beginner-friendly open-source projects.

Currently I am studying for a BSc in Games Technology so I wouldn't say I'm anything above a Junior programmer just yet but my current list of familiar languages are:
- C# (Unity)
- HLSL (Unity)
- C++ (Unreal Editor 4, Godot, & a bare-bones OpenGL-based engine called ASGE)
- GDScript (Godot)
- HTML5 
- CSS3
- JS
- JQuery
- XML (Android Studio)
