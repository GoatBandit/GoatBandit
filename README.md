<h3>Just a little explanation on how I handle my repos (and projects in general) to make them a bit more understandable!</p>
<br>
<h4>Commit Names:</h4>
I generally aim to give each commit a version number in order to keep track of updates. With it I can tell what I've been forgetting to update and also allows me to easily link each file change to the given commit. It just makes life a bit easier I guess.
<h4>Version Numbers:</h4>
The numbers actually mean something (sometimes)! Here's what I aim for the numbers to mean and how they change:
<ul>
<li>- v0.1 = Usually just boilerplate. There's nothing here besides the required initial files</li>
<li>- v0.2 = The projects first baby steps</li>
<li>- v0.3 - v0.8 = The alpha stages!</li>
<li>- v0.9 - v1.2 = The beta stages!</li>
<li>- v1.3+ = The project has left the early stages and should be able to be released!</li>
</ul>
The version numbers are intended to increase by a tenth for each major change (e.g. new features) and a hundreth for each minor change (e.g. bug fixes).
Of course this is only in a perfect world... Usually the version numbers just get messed up but the intention was always there!

âš¡ Fun fact: Goats have rectangular pupils. It never stops being weird to look at...
